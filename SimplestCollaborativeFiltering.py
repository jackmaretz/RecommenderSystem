This is the simplest possible collaborative filtering. 
It implements Manhattan distance to calculate the distance between
two users. 
Each user is an entry of a dictionary. The value associated with each
user is a dictionary containing the books with relative ratings.
The returned reccomendation is a list with the items rated by 
the closest users, sorted in descending order
